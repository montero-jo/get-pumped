            Regular exercise is on the most beneficial habits any one person can have. 
            It’s a great way to stay healthy, reduce anxiety, improve brain function, boost your immune system, etc.    
            </p>         
            As someone who’s been going to the gym regularly for the last 3 years, I couldn’t recommend it enough.
            I've come to understand the gym as an environment to help me grow both physically and mentally.

            Unfortunately, a large majority don't feel that way.
            Many people feel as if the gym is a place in which they wouldn't feel safe in. 
            A steady exercise routine can be very intimidating to approach for newcomers, and
            having to adapt to a new social environment is another added level of difficulty.
