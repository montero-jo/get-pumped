        Routine
        </h1>

        <p>
        Organization is best.
        You're going to have to get pretty good at organizing your schedule to fit regular exercise in there.
        Even if you decide to not make your workouts particularly long, you'll still have to reorganize your day to include 
        however long you want your workouts to be.
        </p>

        <p>
        On top of that, you have to consider any and all factors regarding your activity before and after the gym.
        How long does it take you to get to the gym? Do you have to shower afterwards? Would you need a recovery
        period before you start being productive again? You're going to have to know every single little aspect 
        regarding your needs throughout the day in order to comfortably attend the gym.
        </p>

        <h1>
        Structure
        </h1>

        <p>
        If there's one thing that's confusing for a lot of people 
        (specifically those who want to start weight-lifting), it's the prospect of how you should
        structure your workout plan. By this, I'm referring to the confusion regarding what specific 
        exercises you should do on specific days.
        </p>

        <p>
        The ideal structure for this is to synergize all of your exercises to make sure they're targeting
        similar muscle groups.
        </p>

        <p>
        For example, a lateral pull down (you'll see what this is later) works out the lateral back
        muscles, biceps, rear deltoids, and traps. You might want to pair this up with a dumbell row, which
        targets the same muscle groups, only with a higher emphasis on the rear deltoids. I'm simpler terms,
        work the same muscle groups one day, and then others another day. These are often referred to as "splits".
        </p>

        <h1>
        Don't Forget to Warm Up
        </h1>

        <p>
        No, seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
        Going into workouts cold is one of the leading causes of exercise-related injury. Your muscles need to be limber up
        a little bit before you start doing anything. Warms ups aren't necessarily complicated; properly stretching your preffered muscle group
        or doing a lighter variation the exercise is enough to wake your body up to a more intense session of physical activity.
        It'll also help you with your actual work out, as warmed-up muscles are more effective than stiff ones.
        </p>

        <p>
        but no, really, don't forget to warm up.
        </p>

        <h1>
        Push, Pull, Leg
        </h1>

        <p>
        When it comes to structuring your weight-lifting routine, nothing works better than the Push, Pull, Leg split.
        </p>

        <p>
        The Push, Pull, Leg split means to split your workout between exercises than involve 
        pushing movements, pulling movements, and leg movements. There are a large variety of splits
        you can start off with, but I recommend the PPL over those due to the fact that it's easier to
        understand and organize than the rest 
        (it also only requires you to go to the gym for 3 days out of every week).
        </p>

        <p>
        Push exercises target muscle groups such as the shoulders, chest, and triceps, pull 
        exercises target muscles groups such as the back and biceps, and 
        leg exercises target the leg muscle groups (duh) alongside the core.
        </p>

        <p>
        Not only does this help with organization, it also more-or-less guarantees muscle group isolation.
        This means that you won't be working the same muscle groups several days in a row, which helps with recovery.
        </p>

        <h1>
        But Wait, There's More!
        </h1>

        <p>
        Any good routine will include a decent amount of cardio and focused core workouts.
        The reason I mention this distinctively is because of people's relationships to those workouts.
        </p>

        <p>
        Cardio and core exercises are notorious for being neglected by the average (and even veteran) gymgoer.
        They're honestly the most difficult ones to partake in, so it's entirely understandable as to why people
        have a general distaste of these two. Core muscles are easier to target, as the body uses them automatically 
        for stability during other exercises. Cardio, however, is often the Achille's heel of the average gymgoer.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Cardio increases heart function, increases stamina, and wards of illness. Regular cardio will also assist
        with blood-circulation, (which in turn, helps during weight-lifting) so you should really prioritize getting
        some steps in if you're planning on exercising regularly.
        </p>

        <p>
        Don't worry, this doesn't mean intensive running for 40 minutes straight. Cardio can include a wide variety
        of exercises, so it's just a matter of finding what works for you (walking, running, dancing, )
        </p>

        <h1>
        Final Note
        </h1>

        <p>
        Regardless of what you're going for and how you're going to structure your routine around it,
        just know that you can get a good work out within most environments. If you don't have access to
        a gym with everything you need, you can try finding alternatives that work for you.
        As long as you're safely following the same motions and working your muscles, you'll be doing great.
