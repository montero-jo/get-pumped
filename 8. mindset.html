        <h1>
        Mindset
        </h1>

        <p>
        First thing's first, let's get your mind in the right space for the start of your fitness journey.
        </p>

        <p>
        A good mindset can make your gym experience as a beginner leagues easier. This includes discipline,
        self-awareness, self-care, and patience.
        </p>

        <p>
        Rather than focusing on "alpha male" eqituette of being a dominant beast
        (or any other dudebro sentiments), I want to instill ideologies of patience, self-care, focus,
        and progressive improvement.
        </p>

        <h1>
        Pace Yourself
        </h1>

        <p>
        The common consensus when starting out is to start pushing yourself right off the bat. 
        While we all wish that we could start out running 10 km a day through sheer determination, 
        we have to be a bit more realistic than that.
        </p>

        <p>
        The best piece of advice I would have for newcomers is to start off by doing something you can do consistently.
        This means that you shouldn't be looking to push yourself "beyond your limits" on the first day.
        The only thing that'll really do is exhaust you and make the prospect of returning terrifying.
        </p>

        <p>
        As clich√© as it would be to say "slow and steady wins the race", I believe that it's worth considering.
        There's absolutely nothing wrong with starting off small. Even if you're only walking for 5 minutes on your workout, 
        it's 5 more minutes than you would walk normally and, therefore, an improvement from yesterday. 
        </p>

        Measure by Feel, Not Looks

        </h1>

        <p>
        One of the most common motivators to begin exercising is to "look better". 
        Whether that's losing weight, gaining muscles, or both, most people go the gym
        because they want to look a certain way. 
        </p>

        <p>
        For one, I think we should step away from this type of ideology. Societal standards of beauty
        have plagued us for ages, but we've seen a significant rise of it in the era of social media.
        Trust me, you won't be happy with your body if you're constantly trying to look more and more
        like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth">6"2 jacked Australian dude.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
        Moreso, people who seem healthy because of their appearance might not actually be healthy.
        That instagram model with clearcut abs and 2% body fat? Yeah there's a good chance they're not 
        not eating or drinking that much in order to look that way. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Instead, measure your progress by how you <strong>feel</strong> as opposed to how you look.
        Your appearance is sure to change, but you'll percieve changes in how your body feels long before
        you start looking different. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Not only will that help you measure progress a lot more reliably, it'll also prevent long-term
        health problems. For example, if a certain work out is making a joint hurt regularly, that's your
        body telling you that something is off.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h1>
        Be Patient
        </h1>

        <p>
        If there's one guaranteed need in the gym, its patience. Regardless of your goal, you're going
        to have to wait a while before you see any real changes in happening.
        </p>

        <p>
        Good things take time, and the same applies to your performance within the gym. The reality is
        that you're going to have to work hard for an extended period of time to obtain all of your current goals.
        There's no shortcut, cheat, or suplement that's going to "speed up" the process, and anyone who tells you 
        otherwise is either trying to sell you something or severely misinformed.
        </p>

        <p>
        Regular exercise, proper nutrition, and patience are the only things you'll need. 
        </p>
